# Credit Risk Prediction Project

By Jerrie M. Mataya
Data Extracted From: Kaggle

## Project Overview

This credit risk prediction project is a personal endeavor aimed at applying machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. 
The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that assesses the likelihood of loan defaults based on various borrower characteristics.

- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate borrower profiles to predict the probability of loan defaults.
- **Model Development**: Develop and compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best performing algorithm.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understand which factors most influence credit risk through model interpretability techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project, named `archive (1).zip`, consists of several features relevant to credit risk, including:

- **Credit Amount**: Amount requested by the borrower.
- **Credit Duration**: Duration of the loan in months.
- **Borrower Characteristics**: Information such as income, age, and employment status.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loading and cleaning data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature engineering to create additional predictive features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualization techniques to analyze feature distributions and relationships.
   - Identifying patterns and trends within the data.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implementing algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Comparison of model results to determine the best performer.
   - Interpretation of model predictions using SHAP values to assess feature importance.

## Opportunities for Improvement

While the current model provides valuable insights, there are several areas for potential enhancement, including:

- **Data Quality**: Collecting more comprehensive and high-quality data could improve model accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional features could be explored and created to enhance predictive power.
- **Model Selection**: Testing a broader range of algorithms, including ensemble methods and neural networks, could yield better performance.

## Result/ Report Analysis

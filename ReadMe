# Credit Risk Prediction Project

## Overview

The Credit Risk Prediction project aims to create a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of loan defaults among borrowers. By leveraging various features, including financial history and demographic information, this project provides insights to financial institutions for more informed lending decisions.

## Objectives

- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate borrower profiles to predict the probability of loan defaults.
- **Model Development**: Develop and compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best performing algorithm.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understand which factors most influence credit risk through model interpretability techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project, named `dataset1.csv`, consists of several features relevant to credit risk, including:

- **Credit Amount**: Amount requested by the borrower.
- **Credit Duration**: Duration of the loan in months.
- **Borrower Characteristics**: Information such as income, age, and employment status.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loading and cleaning data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature engineering to create additional predictive features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualization techniques to analyze feature distributions and relationships.
   - Identifying patterns and trends within the data.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implementing algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Comparison of model results to determine the best performer.
   - Interpretation of model predictions using SHAP values to assess feature importance.

5. **Results and Conclusions**:
   - Summary of findings and recommendations based on model outputs.

## Installation and Usage

To run the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn shap
